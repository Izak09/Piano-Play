Interactive Piano Game for Beginners

This project is an interactive piano game designed to help beginner-level students learn and practice piano fundamentals in a fun and engaging way. The game offers an intuitive interface where players can interact with virtual piano keys, learn simple melodies, and follow along with lyrics to popular tunes.

FEATURES:

1. Interactive Piano Keys: The game includes a virtual piano with keys representing different notes, including sharps. Each key is visually responsive, changing color when pressed, which helps reinforce note recognition and timing.

2. Dynamic Lyric Progression: As students progress through the song, they can follow along with the lyrics and corresponding notes. The game updates the lyrics and notes displayed, allowing players to learn in a step-by-step manner.

3. Visual and Audio Feedback: When a key is pressed, its color changes to green, providing immediate visual feedback. Once the key is released, it returns to its original color. This feature helps players associate keys with specific notes and encourages accurate play.

4. Step-by-Step Song Learning: The game includes buttons that allow players to progress through different sections of the song. As each section is completed, new lyrics and notes are revealed, guiding the player through the song "Happy Birthday" in an educational sequence.

5. Replay Functionality: Players can start over at any time, allowing them to practice the song repeatedly until they master it.
How It Works

6. Key Interaction: Each piano key is mapped to a corresponding HTML element. When a key is pressed, the keyPlay function is triggered, changing the key's color. The keyReturn function resets the color when the key is released.

7. Lyric Progression: Buttons are provided to move through different sections of the song. As each button is clicked, the corresponding section of the song’s lyrics and notes are updated on the screen, guiding the player through the melody.

8. Customizable: This project can be easily expanded or modified to include additional songs, keys, or interactive elements, making it a versatile tool for piano instruction.
